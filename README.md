## 📖 Overview

**Jungle Hangman** is a visually immersive, jungle-themed reimagining of the classic word-guessing game. Built with **React**, this application features a stunning **Glassmorphism UI**, dynamic animations, and a "Snake" twist where every wrong guess brings a venomous viper closer!

## ✨ Unique Features

-   **🌿 Immersive Jungle Theme**: Lush green backgrounds, vine accents, and atmospheric visuals that transport you to the heart of the rainforest.
-   **🔮 Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, translucent game cards and containers that blend seamlessly with the jungle backdrop.
-   **🐍 Dynamic Snake Animation**: Instead of a stick figure, watch out for the animated snake that appears with every wrong guess!
-   **🔔 SweetAlert2 Integration**: Beautiful, custom-styled popups for game rules and win/loss notifications.
-   **⌨️ Smooth Interaction**: optimized keyboard controls for a seamless gaming experience.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Start the Game**: The game begins immediately with a hidden word.
2.  **Guess a Letter**: Press any letter key **(A-Z)** on your keyboard to make a guess.
    -   **Correct Guess**: The letter reveals itself in the hidden word slots.
    -   **Wrong Guess**: The "Snake" advances! (One step closer to your doom).
3.  **Win Condition**: Reveal the entire word before you run out of moves.
4.  **Lose Condition**: If you make **6 mistakes**, the snake strikes and the game is over.
